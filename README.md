### Hi, Iâ€™m Alex. ðŸ‘‹

I currently work as a Security Engineer in the UK energy sector.

Here you'll find a few of my interesting projects. _Please_ don't rely on them for anything mission critical, but do feel free to look around! ðŸ˜„

#### [blog.infected.systems](https://blog.infected.systems)
A blog which I started in Oct 2024 as an effort to share more of the things that I'm interested in. My home on the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/).

#### [AS215768](https://bgp.tools/as/215768)
My very own RIPE-allocated AS. A fun project that involved acquiring my own IPv6 prefixes to advertise, and learning far more than I wanted to know about BGP. It's currently fully functional [as you can see here (if your ISP supports IPv6)](https://as215768.net), but there's not a lot on there yet. I have plans to get more adventurous with this project as time goes on.

#### [Pinewall](https://github.com/alexhaydock/pinewall)
My custom Alpine Linux router spin. I've been running this in production as my core (home!) internet gateway since mid-2021. It runs entirely from RAM on a Raspberry Pi 4 using images entirely built within GitLab CI, and leverages Alpine's [LBU](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_local_backup) functionality to overlay configs.

#### [Install-Gentoo](https://github.com/alexhaydock/install-gentoo)
Okay, this one is... not so serious. This is my attempt at building an end-to-end build process for a (mostly) entirely hands-free Stage 3 tarball install of Gentoo Linux using an Ansible playbook. Shockingly it does actually work.
