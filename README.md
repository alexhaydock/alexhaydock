### Hi, I’m Alex. 👋

I currently work as a Security, Orchestration, Automation & Response (SOAR) engineer in the energy sector.

Day-to-day, I spend my time working with SIEM tooling, Ansible, and all the fun stuff that goes into securely maintaining, administering, and monitoring performant “big data” deployments on Linux.

I love containers, [ComplianceAsCode](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode), immutable infrastructure, [BPF](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2021-06-15/bpf-internals.html), and auditd.
